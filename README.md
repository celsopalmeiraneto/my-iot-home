# my-iot-home

This project is an effort to make some home-made automation by using old pieces of IoT hardware I have laying around.

Currently, all it does is read data from the sensors. It should, in the future:

* Send data using MQTT - The Yocto Linux used in the Intel Edison comes with Eclipse Mosquitto pre-installed, so leveraging it would be great.
* Get all data and store somewhere locally.
* Display the data and use actuators.
